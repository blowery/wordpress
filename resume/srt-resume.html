                    <p>I was the lead frontend developer and architect, responsible for working with product managers
                      to turn ideas into working features on the site. During my tenure, we deployed a new search
                      interface, a drag-and-drop subscription management feature, and finally a totally new interface
                      for Bloglines, now hosted at <a href="http://beta.bloglines.com/">beta.bloglines.com</a>, using
                      Dojo and Dijit. I also created a build process to optimize the JavaScript and CSS we delivered to

                      needs of the application and co-authored a client-side AJAX framework suitable for IE6 running on

                      the FactSet system. I created numerous prototype applications, created a single sign-on solution
                      backed by the existing VMS-based user accounts with role-based security, and was part of a team that
                      delivered a cross-platform distributed messaging system, allowing our web services to communicate

                      from an ASP-based application to a new, performance-optimized ASP.NET application. The work allowed
                      the technical documentation department to reduce content deployment time from 48 hours to 1 hour, and to more
                      easily integrate new features into the application.</p>

                      content management system for MusicDirect.com. I worked directly with clients and a team of
                      producers, graphic designers, account managers and operations engineers to determine technical
                      direction for each project, produce technical specifications, and ultimately produce a working web
