== INSTALLATION ==

1. Copy the folder `yet-another-related-posts-plugin` into the directory `wp-content/plugins/` and (optionally) the sample templates inside `yarpp-templates` folder into your active theme.

2. Activate the plugin.

3. Find the Related Posts (YARPP) settings page in your `wp-admin`. If you see a message telling you to build your cache, please build your cache. Otherwise, you will see no related posts anywhere.

NOTE: If you run a large and complex site and/or worry about your SQL query volume, it may be better to simply make sure the "compute related posts on the fly" option is turned on and *not* try to build the cache all at once.

== IN CASE OF TROUBLE ==

If you see an error saying "The YARPP database has an error which could not be fixed", please try manual SQL setup:
